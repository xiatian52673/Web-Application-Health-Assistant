Our project focuses on building a digital hospital suggestion bot based on Amazon Web Service. After registering and logging in to the web application through email or social media account, the users are able to input their symptoms and basic information. Their information will be recorded which can be used to recommend hospitals nearby. Besides, it is easy to contact us in real time in case there are any suggestions given to us. Our project mainly use IAM, Cognito, SNS, Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, S3, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, Amazon Lex to implement.
